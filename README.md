# 👋 Hello, I'm [Your Name] — Frontend Engineer | Design Enthusiast | Synth Explorer

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Frontend Software Engineer based in the USA, passionate about crafting elegant user experiences and building performant, accessible web applications. I thrive at the intersection of design and engineering — blending clean code with thoughtful UI to deliver engaging digital experiences.

## 🎯 About Me

- 💻 **Frontend Focused** — I work with modern web technologies to bring intuitive designs to life. I have a soft spot for animations, micro-interactions, and accessibility.
- 🎨 **Design Explorer** — In my spare time, I reverse-engineer web templates (especially [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)) to sharpen my eye for detail and stay creatively inspired.
- 🎧 **Audio Tinkerer** — Outside of code, I'm often experimenting with waveforms, modular synths, and sound design — or simply at the piano creating something new.
