# 👋 Hello, I'm Edgar Martinez — Frontend Engineer | Sound Designer

I'm a USA-based Frontend Software Engineer passionate about crafting elegant, performant, and accessible web experiences. I thrive at the intersection of design and engineering, combining code and creativity to bring interfaces to life.

Whether I’m reverse-engineering Bootstrap templates for fun or experimenting with sound design in modular synths, I’m constantly exploring the creative edges of technology. I believe in clean code, beautiful UX, and pushing the limits of what the browser can do.

## 🎯 About Me

- 💻 **Frontend-Centric** — I love working with modern frontend stacks to create smooth, accessible, and fast UIs.
- 🎨 **Design-Inspired** — Rebuilding and dissecting templates helps me understand the *why* behind beautiful layouts.
- 🎧 **Sound Explorer** — From modular synths to oscillators, I’m always crafting sound just as much as UI.
